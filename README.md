# React To-Do List App with Supabase and Chakra UI

This is a simple To-Do list application built using React, Supabase, and Chakra UI. The main purpose of this project was to learn how to connect to the Supabase client and use its database service for the backend. The app allows you to create and delete tasks, helping you manage your daily tasks efficiently.

## Features

- Create new tasks with due dates and descriptions.
- Delete tasks you no longer need.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface built with Chakra UI components.

```

Set up your supabase project to access the anon key and url. Create a .env.local :

Acknowledgements
This To-Do list app was born out of the necessity to balance a demanding bootcamp schedule and errands. It served as a personal solution to a real-world problem I was facing.
